3. All methods that need special permissions should be annotated with @Authorize
4. All permissions that should be applied to each method of a controller (except those marked with @NonSecure) should be defined in @Authorize annotated on the controller object.
5. The routes file should have the following route configured:

*     /                       module:scalasecure
